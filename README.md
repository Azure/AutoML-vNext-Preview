# Private Preview: AutoML in Azure ML 2.0 developer experience (DevPlat 2.0)

> Welcome to the PRIVATE PREVIEW of **Azure Machine Learning Automated ML for the Azure ML 2.0 developer experience (DevPlat 2.0)**
> AutoML in the 2.0 developer platform will provide first class API/CLI/SDK support for automated model training.
> This is an early PREVIEW, still not announced and not supported publicly so it's defined as PRIVATE from that point of view, although anyone can access to it.

Automated Machine Learning, also referred to as Automated ML or AutoML, is the process of automating the time consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to quickly and easily build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality.

Apply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify. Automated ML democratizes the machine learning model development process.

Azure AutoML CLI currently supports these three ML tasks:

- Classification (Binary classification and multi-class classification)
- Regression
- Time Series Forecasting 

## Scope for AutoML in 2.0

Azure AutoML in DevPlat 2.0 provides the following main feature areas:

- **CLI (Common-Line Interface)** support for AutoML
- **REST APIs** for AutoML
- **AML Python SDK 2.0** for AutoML (will be available in next previews)

## Prerequisites

1. An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) before you begin.
